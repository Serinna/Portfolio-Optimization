The stock information is extracted from Yahoo Finance, including 10 stocks that are evaluated as the best ones during year 2018. 

In this project, I first used PCA to investigate the factors affecting return prices for the 10 stocks during time 2018, then reconstruct the data with first 5 PCs explaining 88% of variance to reduce noise.

After that, I randomly generated 50000 portfolios, and select the best ones giving:
1. the min variance
2. the largest sharpe ratio
